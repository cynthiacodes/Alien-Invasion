# Alien-Invasion
Created this game within one week of going through the first 9 chapters of the "Python Crash Course A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming" book. This project taught me the importance of seperating your project in smaller file in order to make it easier for other people to understand each step of the project. Additionally, it allows developers to make amendments or extend the project more efficiently.
